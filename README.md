# Eat Da Burger!  Sequelized Edition.
Homework Week 15 - Eat-da-burger

## Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


This application demonstrates a simple full stack application featuring the use of Node, Express server, MySQL, HTML templating using Handlebars, and Sequelize.
